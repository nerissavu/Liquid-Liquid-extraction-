# ðŸ§ª Liquid-Liquid Extraction Calculator

A [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io)-based calculator for analyzing liquid-liquid extraction processes in chemical engineering. This tool visualizes the distribution of solutes between immiscible phases and generates tie-line diagrams for ternary liquid-liquid systems.

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Features

* Calculate distribution ratio (D) between immiscible solvents
* Generate tie-line diagrams for phase equilibrium visualization
* Plot distribution curves showing solute concentration relationships
* Real-time calculation updates
* Interactive parameter adjustment
* Visual representation of phase equilibrium

## ðŸ§® Calculations

The app performs the following calculations:
* Distribution ratio (D) = concentration in organic phase / concentration in aqueous phase
* Equilibrium concentrations in both phases
* Tie-line relationships across concentration ranges
